55,2019 RAV4 Hybrid - AWD performance,"Seeing the previews and information for the 2019 RAV4 Hybrid has definitely gotten my attention.  I'm curious how the AWD on the hybrid model performs.

How does the current generation of RAV4 Hybrid AWD perform, in terms of inclement weather and also for *mild* off-roading.  I emphasize ""mild"" here, as although I will leave the pavement from time to time, I have no plans to take this thing rock crawling.  My current vehicle is a '16 Subaru Impreza, and it handles what I've thrown at it so far, though ground clearance is a concern on the Impreza.

My understanding is that they are improving the AWD-I system from the previous generation: 

https://toyotanews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/all+new+2019+toyota+rav4+serves+breakthrough+debut+nyias.htm

&gt;When paired with the new All-Wheel Drive with Intelligence (AWD-i), RAV4 Hybrid increases the total torque to the rear wheels‚Äîwhich is electronically driven‚Äîby 30 percent compared to the current generation AWD-i system. By adopting a new control system that optimally distributes torque to the rear wheels based on the driving conditions, the new AWD-i system offers high off-road performance, handling, and ability.

I don't need a ""best in class"" AWD system, rather I need a decent AWD that will deal with inclement weather and modest off-road tasks.  If I was looking for hardcore off-roading, I'd be looking at something else.

The reviews that I've seen for the current gen seem mixed.

61,Service Interval and Warranty ‚ÄúTolerance‚Äù,"I‚Äôm a fairly new Toyota owner and I‚Äôve currently heading towards my first 30,000 mile service. The problem is that the holidays are approaching just in alignment with when I need to do this service. My vehicle is running fine and I don‚Äôt suspect any problems and have been following the service intervals.

This is the question - what is the ‚Äútolerance band‚Äù around the dates and mileage maintenance is due that I can be in without voiding my car‚Äôs bumper/bumper, drivetrain, and hybrid system warranty?

I did some searching and some Toyota dealerships have their own warranties, and they seem to indicate the ‚Äútolerance band‚Äù is either:

- Plus or minus 30 days from the due date

- Plus or minus 1000 miles from when maintenance is needed

Is that the correct tolerance? It seems pretty reasonable. I am also going to call the dealership tomorrow but was curious what the people here thought. 

**EDIT:** I am not sure if I am reading this right, but the little warranty/maintenance guide makes it sound like there isn‚Äôt some magic numbers.

I have some areas on my car that I‚Äôm concerned about with the paint. I also noticed that some of the crevices on my rims have the powder coating missing.

I contacted Toyota and they directed me to my local dealership. I went for the first time and they had a look at my car. The woman  took pictures with her phone and said that she would get back to me once Toyota gets back to her. 

A week later she asked me to come in and would have her manager and the district manager look at my car.  (Don‚Äôt know which kind of manager.) The manager had a look yesterday and didn‚Äôt really say much. He did let me know that he would speak with the district manager and come up with a decision. The district manager was sick so he didn‚Äôt see the car. They told me this upon arriving, so I didn‚Äôt have a chance to ask if I could stop in another day.

- Not sure why it was necessary for me to come in, because they had pictures of the problem areas. The district manager wasn‚Äôt there and I was told he makes the decision wether to approve or not.

Now i am being told I will have an answer as to wether or not things will be approved within 2 days. So now is the district manager basing the decision off the pictures? I thought the point for the second appointment was for them to see it in person.

It is time-tested setup which allows owner to feel free on and off the road. Of course, difflocks and winches are welcome and some times necessary too. But it is not 'standard' it is 'prepared'.

96,2016 Avalon Wind sound on door?,"I love Avalon's! This is my third and I got the limited (oh yeah!) 2016 Avalon limited bought used 4 months ago from none toyota dealer at 15k. I'm currently at 18k miles. When I purchased the car I noticed a wind sound coming from the passenger back door on the interstate. Sounds like the back window is cracked just barely. Took it to the dealer and they noticed the back tire wheel well bumper was a little loose and there was a piece of black trim between the passenger door and back passenger door was broken. No big deal, I took it back to the place I bought it and they replaced it. Unfortunately it didn't make the sound go away and it may have gotten worse. I love my Toyota but I paid for quiet cabin. Should I take it back to the dealership I bought it from and ask them to take it on a test drive or go to the Toyota dealership and see if there is some type of warranty that could fix it? Trying to be frugal but do things the right way. They said my car had a clean car fax but this situation makes me think I was lied to.

99,at my wits' end with my 4runner,"Hey all, I'm looking for any advice as to what I should do with the 4runner that I own. I have a 2003 4runner. I bought the vehicle a few years back from a dealership I worked at and the car had 160k on it. 

When I got it I knew I had to replace 2 of the o2 sensors, the other 2 had already been replaced and these 2 were on limited time. Eventually those two went out and I replaced them as well. 

Everything was fine and dandy until inspection time came rolling around. Every year since I bought the car I had to replace the o2 sensors to get the vehicle to pass inspection, because the check engine light would come on and indicate the o2 sensors... also the exhaust started to smell like sulfur. So this issue was annoying because with all my other vehicles I had in the past the o2 sensors lasted longer than a year. Eventually it got to the point where even after changing them the check engine light would come back on, and the sulfuric smell was constant. I thought the smell was due to a bad cat, but had an exhaust specialist look at it and the exhaust and cat is fine.

Earlier this year I decided to do some research to see if anyone else had this issue. I found that some 4runner owners had the same issue. Apparently a sensor in the transmission fails, and causes the main body wiring harness to wick up transmission fluid and it gets all the way to the o2 sensor connectors, which is causing the check engine light to come on and reading the o2 sensor malfunction. I also found service records in the owner's manual from the previous owner.... it seems they took the 4runner to the dealer multiple times due to the o2 issue, as well as the smell of the exhaust. Multiple Toyota mechanics couldn't figure out the problem.

So, I unplugged the o2 sensors, and wouldn't you know it? Transmission fluid. Everywhere. Cleaned the connectors and let them dry, plugged everything back in and the light came back immediately.

At one point I reached out to Toyota and asked them if they could do anything to help me, like issuing a recall, as I've found many other 4runner owners with the same issue. Their response to me was to take it to Toyota for a diagnosis and that I would have to pay for this diagnosis. This immediately made me see red, as the previous owners did the same and there was no resolution. I don't want to pay a diagnosis fee for what I already know is wrong with the car, I just wanted help with the vehicle. 

At this point the 4runner is 15 years old with 195k on it, and I just don't know what to do. I don't feel its worth it for me to fix at this point as I already have another vehicle, and reaching out to Toyota has gotten me nowhere. I listed it for sale but no hits because to replace the main body wiring harness is stupid time consuming.

I plan to do mostly city driving in the cold winter's of Chicago. I also plan to keep this car for 10+ years. Based on math, it seems the amount saved on gas will be equivalent to the cost of maintenance for a new battery, if I'll ever need a new one. 

I have never had experience with hybrids so I don't know how they drive, or how reliable it will be. I also heard they're sticking to Nickel battery than lithium ion so I don't know how I feel about that.

115,02 4Runner P0420 error code,"So my rig has about 205k on it, and recently I just recently started receiving the typical engine and VSC warning lights that you do for most problems.  I have an OBD II reader and its reporting the P0420 Powertrain ""Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 1)"" error when plugged in.

The first time it happened was in the mountains offroading, so I called a shop when I got cell coverage and talked to the mechanic.  His advice was to clear the code and see if it returned.  It did not. We got down and took it to the shop to be sure, they plugged it in and ran a test on the engine and exhaust and found no issues.  Said the engine was performing fantastically for its age.

Fast forward 2 months and the same code pops again.  Follow the same steps clearing out the code, and it does not return when cleared out and driven.

But this keeps occurring and the car is at the age where Im sure the catalytic converter is reaching its life expectancy.  Basically Im not sure if its an issue with the sensors or the cat.   This rig is both a daily driver and used for offroading, and not stock.  Ive replaced the spark plugs, put in a K&amp;N Cold Air Intake, put bumpers and armor on, along with the Tundra brake upgrade and rear-diff breather mod.  I dont intend to trade it in.

119,Toyota seems to care so much about reliability and I love that.,"I have noticed Toyota still uses naturally aspirated engines in their cars instead of turbocharged and they also use older technology in their cars. An example would be the Toyota yaris hatchback still uses a 4 speed auto and a 5 speed manual and I believe the transmission and engine date back to the echo but you never really hear any issues with the Toyota yaris hatchback. The corolla also uses the same 1.8L from the previous generation. I believe Toyota does this so they could keep the same engine but keep improving which could be for the excellent reliability  known with Toyota vehicles. I also appreciate Toyota for still having naturally aspirated port and direct injected engines in their cars instead of Honda using direct injected turbocharged engines.

128,Strong vibration in my 03 tacoma,"I have a 2003 Tacoma, 3.4L 6cyl with 4 wheel drive. A couple weeks ago, I noticed this vibration that I could feel all over the car (steering wheel, floor, everywhere). It's not bad like screws shaking out of place, but it's very noticeable and annoying, an my gas mileage has gone down since it got worse.

When it first got real noticeable, it was only when I was under load, going above like 30mph. It didn't really get worse with higher RPM- it seemed to be the worst when I was going like 50-60mph around 2000 RPM. 

I checked and checked again, and the only thing I could find was that the center bearing on my driveshaft was completely gone, so the driveshaft was just sitting on the big rubber gasket, and it had a lot of play because of that- I could force it up and down about a 1/2 inch in each direction. I was positive this was the problem, so I grudgingly took it to a dealer (I do not have a press). 

I get it back with a brand new center bearing, rubber gasket, bracket, the whole works. The driveshaft no longer has play in that bracket. Turns out, this didn't fix the vibration. It's the same intensity when I'm under load, and now when I take my foot off the accelerator, it pauses, and then vibrates even worse when I'm coasting. This is new since it only ever did it under load. There's also some squeaking coming from under the truck that I can hear pretty well when I'm driving under 5mph with the window down, but I'm not sure if it's connected or not.

I checked the U-joints and they all seem tight. I don't think it's a wheel bearing because of how it really only did it under load before. The only thing I've heard that it might be is a stuck E-brake cable, but yet I'm still not sure. Does anyone have any advice as to what it could be? It has 180k on it, with no modifications and the tires are 6 months old.

147,Accident advice needed,"Apologies if this if the wrong sub and I'd appreciate being pointed to the right one if it is.

Well, our 2014 Camry was rear ended about an hour ago.  Luckily it was a mini Cooper so it only hit the bumper and there's very little or no visible damage (it's dark and raining so I'll look more closely tomorrow).  It was hard enough that my phone fell off its strong magnetic mount and the sunroof cover, which was closed, slid back a few inches.  It's too soon to tell if we're injured.  I'll be contacting the other driver's insurance tomorrow just to get it on record.

Questions for insurance adjusters and/or collision repair experts.  I assume that even though there's no visible damage, it's possible that the substructure could be damaged and should be inspected, right?  Are there any pitfalls I should look out for?  Questions I should be asking?  Should the seatbelts be checked as well?

148,2009 Toyota Corolla Coolant Replacement,"So I started trying to undertake some of the maintenance activities for my vehicle and to make a long story short, I recently replaced a failing water pump on my vehicle. I wanted to get a better idea of what kind of routine maintenance I can perform to lessen the likelihood that my waterpump would fail and found that I should be replacing my coolant every 100k-150k miles.

So my question about replacing coolant is:

1.) When I drain the old coolant, is it better to drain from the petcock valve or drain from the lower radiator hose?

2.) If I'm replacing the coolant with Premixed Zerex Asian coolant, is it necessary to flush the system with distilled water?

151,2009 Toyota Land Cruiser Prado Radio Bluetooth issue,"Hi all,

I've recently acquired a used Land Cruiser Prado with the factory fitted Radio / CD player combo. It also has bluetooth functionality which I tried to make use of. I've managed to pair my mobile phone (Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact) to the radio, but the only thing I can get out of the speaker is music and voice navigation prompts. I'm unable to make or answer calls.

On further investigation, I've discovered that when paired, in the phone bluetooth settings the car radio is listed as ""media audio"" and ""contact sharing"" only. There is no option for ""call audio"" which explains why I was unable to answer any incoming calls. I've tried clearing all bluetooth pairings and starting from scratch but am still getting the same result.

To the point where if Google Maps is running, it‚Äôs shouting directions at me.

178,Service question,"Hey guys,

Yesterday I went in to get service for the first time on a certified pre-owned 2015 Camry after driving about 5k miles on it (it now has ~19400 miles total).

When they were going to change the oil, they said the last place to do service on it had tightened the oil pan too much and it could possibly be stripped. If they removed it they may not be able to put it back on, and it would cost ~$700 to replace.

Now, this didn't make sense to me because this was the first time I went in to get the oil changed, and seeing as I only bought the car certified pre-owned last year from that same dealership, wouldn't they have been the last ones to remove it? If the oil pan really does have to be replaced couldn't I argue this point to avoid paying?

Also, what are the chances that there's something like this wrong with the car on my first time getting it serviced? I'm very skeptical about it.

207,Toyota OEM Tire Lugs,"This is absolutely a noob question, so please don't snicker too much. I was having a random discussion with a friend and somehow we got to talking about tire lugs. He mentioned after his car got serviced that the tire lugs should be installed cone side down (meaning the cone of the lug should be facing the inside of the tire), but the service tech installed them randomly where some of the cones were facing towards the tire and some were facing away from the tire. From what I could tell, it looked like the lugs were bi-directional because we were able to remove a couple without any issues and didn't see any sort of cross treading on the lug stud. This leads me to my question. Is there a specific direction tire lugs need to be installed? I know there is a star pattern the lug studs need to be installed in, but my question is whether or not it makes a difference which direction the actual tire lugs cone is pointing? Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.

220,"Replacing passenger window due to scratches, worth it on a new car?","Long story short, I bought a new car and two days later noticed the driver side passenger window has some scratches that are visible in direct sunlight. The dealer has agreed to replace it with non oem, but they did want to caution that it is an invasive process and may not be the best thing for a new car. It sucks paying 25k for a car and having the scratches annoy you daily. Is it worth changing out the glass or should I just deal with it?

224,Lights on in my corolla dash,"So please forgive me if this is not the right place to post, but this issue only just came up and while I did try to google it, one solution I tried did not work out. 

I drive a 2010 Toyota Corolla S, and mechanically, it's given me basically no issues in my years of owning it. I bought it new and it now has about 113,000 miles. A few months ago, I moved to central PA, and my commute involves going up and over a mountain. Nothing particular there, but I figured I would share the detail. Recently, we got a good amount of snow in the region, so of course it made for some slips and slides while driving. In particular, I had a lot of difficulty getting out of my parking spot in my apartment complex, so I did turn off my traction control to help out with that. Maybe after a day of driving again after the snow, I'm commuting back home, and out of nowhere, I notice that not only does my check engine light come on, so does the symbol for the traction control, with the VSC light also blinking. I tried pushing the traction control button on and off, and nothing. I started the car the next day, and the lights were still on. I found a solution online that involved tightening the gas cap and turning on the car while holding the brake and odometer button, and still, lights. 

I know this is an issue, because I was able to google it, but I'll still probably take it to a local shop or dealer soon. Meanwhile, does anyone have a clue as to why this might be happening? And if and when I take my car in for repairs, is it something that will be a major cost? Admittedly, finances are tight, and I would prefer to not have to shell out huge amounts of cash before a holiday weekend. 

Thanks in advance!

257,Dont buy thew new camry if you like to DIY,"So today was tire rotation day, and since I am no longer covered under toyota care, my 2018 camry will be DIY from now on. And first little task becomes a major disappointment. My 2015 Lexus is less of a maintenance disappointment than this.

There are only 2 places to place the car jack now. Front and rear, both center. The plastic covers the rest of the underneath and even if there is a line of frame somewhere i would have to go through about 8 screws to get to it on each side, and then remounting the plastic. So my one jack and one jack stand, can no longer rotate tires on a friggin toyota. Can no longer just jack up one side, and rotate the tires.

265,"2014 RAV4 was hit, unsure if body shop is doing what they should be","So essentially my car got hit while I was in a store. Decent damage to the driver-side rear quarter panel and bumper but that's it. Literally no damage (not even a scratch) to the door or anything in front of the rear quarter panel. The body shop just gave me an estimate of $9k (insurance covers it, thank god) and two weeks before the car will be ready. Their original estimate was less than half of that and the last time I went here it was only 3 days (albeit it was just a bumper replacement). The two weeks and price didn't seem right to me, so I looked at pictures they sent during the estimate process and noticed they removed the interior door panels. I could be wrong but I feel like the interior door panels are in no way related to the damage.

292,"Entune often won't connect, even though my phone is plugged in","Hi Fellow Toyota users, 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been getting increasingly frustrated at my Toyota (2018 Camry Hybrid XLE)'s inability to connect to my phone. I will plug my phone in, turn on the Entune App, and then sometimes the car will let me use the app on the car's screen; but mostly it won't. It just tells me to make sure my phone is plugged in (which it is) or that the app is running (which it is). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have looked on the Toyota website hoping they would have a troubleshooting page, but I haven't found one; just an unhelpful FAQ page. When I google this problem, I get a million results of people asking how to connect their phone over bluetooth; but my problem isn't that. I am connected with a wire, and it still doesn't work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this happening to other folks? Any suggestions?

I've checked to see that the apps on both my phone and in the car are updated, and they seem to be.

I purchased a used 2014 Toyota Rav4 Limited with 14,000 miles on it for 20k in June of 2017.  It currently has about 24,000 miles on it.  We need a routine oil change, but recently I've noticed there is a slow leak in the front right tire that we need to fill about once every ten days.  I'm also considering having the brake pads swapped out since I've noticed some rocking driving at highway speed and up and down hills.

My question is since the tires are probably within warranty, and the car might be under manufacture warranty, should I take it back to the dealer to see what they cover? Or am I better off finding a more local mechanic that might be cheaper?

I checked the oil level last weekend it's it about twice what it should be. I waited a few days and made sure I was on level ground, checked again (after having it parked for around 10 minutes) and it's still way too high. I'm planning to let a little oil out at a time until the dipstick is back in the middle, but I that seems like a bad idea since I added the amount of oil the truck takes.

So I've been trying to get this TSB update performed at my dealership but my dealer keeps telling me that my car is ""running like normal"" and that they weren't able to replicate the issue I was getting. However, after 2600 miles, I definitely still feel a jerky / sluggish shift shock when going from 1-&gt;2. So to those who successfully installed the TSB update, which dealership did you go to and what did you say? Thanks for the help!

Couple of days ago I had a headlight out. So I went and bought another bulb, changed it - fine, all good. Then on the same day when I was getting fuel, I have noticed in the window reflection that my DRLs are not working. DRLs in this car are combination of a smaller than headlight bulb to the side of it and a LED stripe. They should always come on automatically, but yo can also switch them on by yourself. So this is what happens when I switch them on: http://sendvid.com/jzqtg6jr As you can see the stripe is flashing for literally a second and then it cuts off. It's the same on both sides.

I checked the bulbs for the DRLs - they are both fine. I also checked the fuses, no issue there either. I'm not that experienced car user to look passed that, hence I need some help to see where should I go from here.

352,Issue with car‚Äôs suspension before warranty ended?,"Hey guys! I bought a certified pre owned Toyota Camry hybrid at a dealership.

When I drove the car off the lot and went over speed bumps, I noticed a loud creaking noise from my front suspension. They changed the bushings on the car and it quieted it down a lot (still heard it a tiny bit, but I thought that it wasn‚Äôt bad enough to bring it back and go through the inconvenience of not having a car while it gets fixed for something minor. A month later, I didn‚Äôt hear it anymore. Now, 6 months later, it‚Äôs making it again. I do notice that when the temperature goes below 50F, it makes the noise. Thus makes sense to why the noise was going away and is now coming back.

I brought the car back and they replaced the same bushings again and they said that they couldn‚Äôt reproduce the issue, yet I told them to drive over speed bumps, but they didn‚Äôt. I have a gps in my car and they only did a lap around the block in my neighborhood where there‚Äôs no speed bumps...

Now i realized my car is out of warranty now - and they never fixed the true issue. Should I bring it to corporate? They seem to not be taking this issue seriously and the loud creaking in the cold is annoying - not something that a car should be making that is 2 years old.

So, I went to the dealership today in response to the recall (or is it a system update?). However, an hour in to the process, the mechanic told me that the computer system in my 2016 Corolla isn't responding to the update and they're not sure what's going on. They asked me if anyone had been tampering with the fuel box (no) or if anyone else had driven the car (nope, just me). They checked again. I waited another hour or so.

I have a 2019 Camry SE, but was advised by Toyota Corp they have tested in all Carplay models and it is not operating as Apple intends. Toyota has missed the mark on a very clear standard.

Update:

Spoke with A toyota case manager today. I was advised Toyota has confirmed their vehicles do not follow the carplay standard to acknowledge Maps prompts to lower Music audio. They have also confirmed they will not be fixing it and that it is working as intended. I explained over and over how this is false advertising but it fell on deaf ears. I am awaiting a callback from the Office of the President at Toyota USA. We will see if anyone can get this to an Engineer for resolution instead of just telling me its meant to be this way. I am initiating a buy back request based on this as the car was misrespresented as including Carplay, but instead includes a broken version of.

491,"If you have a late 90's early 2000's Toyota that has a securikey remote for the alarm system, you can easily disable it.","This next paragraph is just a story. If you want to you can skip to the next one for disabling it. 

In the late 90's and early 2000's Gulf States Toyota, a Toyota distributor based in Houston, Texas, and dealers they supplied to installed these aftermarket alarm systems in their cars. This led many including the last owner of my Corolla to believe that it was a factory option. When I first got my vehicle there were a bunch of red flags that told me the alarm system in it was aftermarket. For example, whenever I would lock the car with the remote and then unlock it with the regular key, the alarm would go off and I could not disable the alarm unless I used the remote. Also the impact sensor (for if someone smashed a window or something) was super sensitive. If I closed the hood too hard, if I closed a door too hard, or I hit something in the wrong spot it would go off. I still bought the car because it was a great deal but I called the guy later and asked him about it. He said it came like that and he insisted he bought it like that from a dealer. Today I found out that was true.

Anyway getting to the disabling part. Underneath the steering column there's a block box that controls the alarm system. If you can't find it follow the wire from the little red button you'll see next to the steering wheel. Unplug it and you're done. No more shitty alarm. I wish I had known this when I first bought the car so I didn't have to constantly deal with it.

492,"Downsizing winter tires, 09 Matrix XR","Tires are 205-55R-16

I have nearly new snow tires from previous car: 185-60R-15.  

I don't have winter wheels that would fit, but I could still save a fair amount of money I think buying rims and using my old tires vs. selling tires and buying a new set. (I live in Quebec, lots of snow, \~6 months of winter. I drive very little.)

My mechanic says the size difference is too big, it's a bad idea to use my old snow tires. He says 195 would be OK, but 185 is pushing it. He also sells tires.

According to an online calculator the size difference is -4.6%. Speedometer inaccuracy would be 3mph at 60mph. But since I'd be going \*slower\* than the reading I don't see how this is dangerous.

Is this safe? Has anyone out there done it? If so, how as performance in the snow?

497,Any sienna owners with upgraded head units? (2011 to 2014),"Hi everyone! new to the forum! 

I guess I landed here because I feel a little frustrated (I have posted on [www.siennachat.com](https://www.siennachat.com) though) 

I feel frustrated because the group of people that designed the headunit of the siennas between those years deserve a special place in hell

also, the guys that designed the dashboard deserve a place beside the headunit guys. 

If you dont know, the stereo that comes with the sienna between 2011 and 2014 seems like an after thought, it looks and feels like something that came out of my  old 1995 cadillac STS:  why an after thought? because they took that 1995 radio and added bluetooth... and its bad.

&amp;#x200B;

after much consideration and trying to keep the oem look I tried installing  one of those seicanne units, and the sienna version at least, is a POS: numerous reboots, tons of lag with the interface and the like: it looked like factory though.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that my second option is to get a double din unit with one of those mounting kits, but again, I dont like how a double din radio looks in the dash.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone here, that owns a sienna, between those years, installed something that looks good and works ok at least?

I recently discovered the new Corolla (hatchback and touring) hybrid featuring the 1.8L 122hp and 2.0 180hp powertrains.

The official website says that the fuel consumption's gonna be around 4.1L/100km, mixed.

Do we already have actual specs for these cars? For those who already have a Toyota Hybrid powertrain, are these numbers realistic or are they made up in perfect laboratory conditions?

507,Issues with 2013 Toyota Corolla S front locks,"Hey guys wanted to see if anyone else had this issue. My FOB is intermittent with my drivers side door and not responding to my front passenger side door. I‚Äôve reset the FOB and the dealership has and nothing has fixed the issue. Is there a relay or fuse that you know off that might have cause both from doors to have this issue? Back doors work fine, no issues with them. I have to turn the key manually to lock the drivers door and then the car will recognize all doors are locked and make the beep noise. I hope it‚Äôs not the actuator on the door because that is $$$$. Was curious if this was common issue with this car. Couldn‚Äôt find any references in the manual for a fuse or relay that controls this aspect of the car. This all started back in January when I started my car up on a cold day and my control panel was spitting out all different alarms which went away after a couple mins on idle. To say that both actuators failed at the same time, is hard to believe (just an idea)

561,"04 Rav4 has water leaking all over the seats when it rains, please help!","Hey folks. First of all I'm not trying to be lazy. I generally don't mess with the insides of engines except a couple times but otherwise I tend to work on everything else to save money.

The problem is, it keeps raining like crazy here.

Whenever it does the driver seat especially and part of the passenger seat (both front) get soaked.

I've read multiple things always pointing to the moon/sun roof leaking and the drain tubes being plugged. Maybe they're really plugged because I didn't notice them but anyway....

To rule out the roof window, I cleaned it with water then rubbing alcohol to really get it dried/cleaned. Then I sealed all around it with silicon. Kind of ghetto but I don't care, we just need it to last through the winter before we get another.

After sealing it, we can dump water on it like crazy with no leaks. It's like it has to be coming from something else. It's building up under the cloth on the inside. It's running down into the moon/sun (I always mix them up) roof BUTTONS on the inside but I can't help but wonder if it's leaking around the rack on top or something.

From the inside there's two screws with plastic washers which the water is running through but again it cannot be the glass up top at this point. I sealed it good with repeated passes and it just won't leak when I try to make it.

Anyone have any input?

It's a pain to try to diagnose a leak like this while it keeps raining. Aside from the break the other day to seal it with silicon I just simply haven't had a clear enough period to address it better.

I'm sure someone's had a similar experience. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: It's always possible that the rain may apply more pressure than my cups of water but the silicon truly is holding well. I didn't just fill in all around the sunroof but even applied it an inch out on every side (thin). It's sealed good. No part of it is coming up period.

612,Oil Consumption For 2009 Scion tC,"Hey Reddit, so I have an issue and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I brought in my car earlier this year to perform an oil consumption test, which it passed as it was consuming at or less than 1 quart per 1,000 miles.

Within 4,000 miles of an oil change that was performed around a couple months ago, my oil light started coming on whenever I was braking. I found it weird, checked my dipstick, and had oil showing only on the very top of the dipstick.  I added 3 quarts of oil to bring it between the Maximum and Minimum fill lines.

I brought into a dealership on Tuesday about a week later (10/2/18), where they simply topped off my oil and my coolant. I checked my oil level yesterday (10/4/18) and noticed that my oil level was dangerously low again, with oil showing only on the tip of the dipstick.

This morning, I went into the dealership again where I was told that my car no longer qualifies under Toyota‚Äôs warranty extension regarding this issue and that I‚Äôll have to cover all the costs out of pocket. I called Toyota‚Äôs corporate office and was told the same thing.

Being your typical broke college student with a Scion tC, I have nowhere near enough money for engine work and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with myself if I were to sell it to someone, knowing that they‚Äôll either break down or pay thousands in repairs.

My '03 Jeep Grand Cherokee is probably gonna have to get junked tomorrow/next week, so I'm starting to look for a replacement. What's caught my eye is a [nice looking '05 Tacoma TRD Offroad](https://www.cstatic-images.com/supersized/in/01db0e74a999e64f5a72f2fb4a980fd5.jpg) for $15k, equipped with the V6, the 6-Speed manual, and has 145k miles. 

This seems to be ever-so-slightly pricey, and based on my research it sounds like the 6-Speed in these doesn't get a lot of love (and I'd have to learn manual to drive it home).

621,Options for updating entune nav data on 2013 Prius C (cross post from /r/prius),"Yesterday I stopped by my local dealer to schedule my yearly inspection and an oil change. Seeing how the nav data is 5 years old, and I have had a couple of minor problems with newer streets over the years, I figured I'd ask about the update costs. I had seen online people talking about $150 or $200, which while a bit steep, doesn't seem too bad to spend every 5 years. My dealer quoted me $360, which is stupid expensive.

So I'm going to inquire at one or two more Toyota dealers and maybe a couple of shops that work on Toyota. Maybe my dealer is just being greedy.

Beyond the above ideas, are the any options online? Is there a way for me to order the upgrade online and install myself? Hell, at these crazy prices I'd be willing to find a torrent if I knew which version I needed.

Any advice is appreciated.

No, telling me to use my phone, a Garmin, etc. is not what I want to hear. I know those are options, but I really like the built-in navigation so I'll be pursing this as best I can.

622,Toyota Dealership Broke Side Mirror,"TLDR; Dealership broke my Mirror, and refuses to compensate me further, they also withdrew an offer they didn‚Äôt make aware to me, because I left a ‚Äúbad‚Äù review.

So I went in for a diagnostic on my new (to me) car yesterday, and upon them returning the car, the side mirror was missing! (As seen in image 1), after driving, I shortly noticed it was missing! Upon returning they checked the cameras and did see it was there when I arrived, and gone when I left.

They said they‚Äôd fix it in 2 days after they get the part and paint it.

My mother shared a Facebook post I made, and others said I need to get compensated for all these extra hours I have to waste with them, and the fact I have to drive without the mirror for two days.
Eventually they were called up by someone who thought that wasn‚Äôt right, and they said they‚Äôd do the rest of the diagnostic for free ($78.00)

This morning I got a *text* (image 2) that they got the part in already, and they are ready to install it, but because I left a bad review (image 3), and I ‚Äúrefuse‚Äù to allow them to make it right, they no longer are offering waving the price on the diagnostic.....

What do I do at this point? I‚Äôve wasted so many hours over this... and it‚Äôs very stressful.

Needles to say we could not agree on a price and we walked away. But i am curious is this standard practice with Toyota?

631,2011 Toyota RAV4 Sport Question,"Alright I reviewed subreddit rules and think this is ok to post but let me know if it‚Äôs not. 

I recently purchased a 2011 Toyota RAV4 Sport AWD &amp; run into an issue. I‚Äôve googled it but can‚Äôt find the exact solution I need. 

My model does NOT have auto lights. It has ON, OFF, and parking lights (of course brights and fog as well). 

The car does not ding or warn you if you are exiting the car and the lights are left on. I‚Äôve killed the battery 4 times now doing it. I‚Äôm replacing battery today but don‚Äôt want this to happen again. 

From what I‚Äôve read, this car is supposed to be ‚Äúsmart‚Äù about lights and if you do a series of events, the lights automatically turn off in 30 secs. 

So when you get home, lights are in ON position. 

Then turn car ignition to OFF. 

Get out and have all doors shut within 30 secs. Lights should shut off even if in ‚ÄúON‚Äù position. 

Problem is, if I have groceries and I‚Äôm running between car and house with the trunk open, I don‚Äôt complete the sequence in 30 secs and there is no warning that I left my lights on. So they stay on and kill battery. 

Another option is if you press lock on the fob twice, it turns the lights off. Again, another thing to remember. It‚Äôs not instinct for me so something I have to remember to do just like remembering to shut lights off  (I‚Äôve either had a car that dings at me or has auto lights in my life so far). Also, I swear I did everything in the sequence one time, intentionally, and still killed the battery because lights didn‚Äôt shut off. 

This ‚Äúsmart‚Äù design is infuriating me! I wish it would just old school ding. I believe RAV4s roughly from 2008-2012/2013 have this similar design. 

So RAV4 owners without auto lights... is this true? How do you get it to work? Is it possible a door sensor isn‚Äôt registering and so it never kills the rights? Can I rig the car to ding at me? I don‚Äôt know what to do.

644,22RE revving issue -- SOS (x-post from /r/ToyotaPickup)," 

Good day!

I have recently acquired a 1985 Toyota Celica GT-S in relatively good condition, however I am encountering an issue that the previous owner, of whom I am close friends with, has spent a large amount of effort attempting to track down. It was sold out of necessity as he is in the Navy and was being stationed in a different part of the country, so I thought I‚Äôd try and give this thing a whirl.

For some odd reason, the car wants to think it has a soft limiter at around 2-2.5k RPM. I can drive the car normally, everything works, but it will fall completely on its face once it hits this imaginary rev limiter. Below is the list of things that have since been replaced and readjusted between myself and the PO.

Throttle Position Sensor -- New and adjusted

Radiator Repainted

MAF Cleaned &amp; Installed w/ fresh gaskets

Fuel Injectors have been cleaned and tested

Fuel pressure regulator &amp; damper are new

Fuel filter is new (but on backwards, fixing this soon)

Fuel pump functions as intended, flow tested.

Igniter is new, coil is new, spark plugs are new, wires are new

O2 sensors are new.

This issue seemed to have occurred without warning, as he was driving the car regularly until this problem emerged. I noticed this is a pretty common issue with 22RE‚Äôs and solutions are often not advertised.. but any leads will be of a great help. I‚Äôd really like to get this old majestic tofu mobile back on the road.

I will be taking a video of it to supplement the details I‚Äôve been able to pass on.

649,"Hi guys, me again with my 02 camry","Hi guys, i posted a week or two ago of my new car, an 02 camry with 78k thats in perfect condition. Ive pretty much had to let it sit for the last two weeks because of insurance reasons. Now that im insured i took it on its first real test drive today.

The reason why im creating this thread is because the issue i had i couldn't find anywhere online. Ok, so the issue im having is the transmission. I noticed this when i had the car in the driveway id start it up and once it warmed up i shifted thru the gear selector. When i shifted from p t r and r to d my car sounds exactly like a go-kart. That weird little 2 stroke engine sound. When i shift it back to n or p the sound goes away. Im not sure if thats an issue its just something i noticed.

Now my main concern: it happened twice. I was on my drive driving up a hill at about 45 mph. The car just slammed into gear i guess? I noticed its really sensitive to downshifting on the pedal. Maybe i didn't give it enough gas or too much but when i got to the hill it slammed in or out of gear.

The second time i was on the highway doing about 61mph and i believe i was steady and in 4th gear. But the same thing happened again it slammed in or out of gear. That one concerned me. In really not sure what the deal is. On my way back from the store i went back on the highway and tried to re creat the scenario, it pressed on the gas and let off the gas 3 times and then it did the slam again. Ive checked the tranny fluid when i first brought the car home it looked to be full and it was still a redish color.

I'm not sure how to describe it but as I approach a stop sign I keep even pressure on the pedal and it all feels normal but when scrubbing the last few mph it suddenly lurches to a stop.

694,2014 Camry change how Entune gets cover art? And question about leaving car on.,"Just got a Camry and I love it but I had some questions.

1. When I play music through Bluetooth, it displays the title, albums, artist and all that on the display. But for cover art is usually displays nothing, but when it does it's usually a rabdom picture of the artists face. Even when I find it displays an artist, it only does so for a some songs from that artist. It's very rare that the actual album art will play.

I know it's not too big of a deal but it's nice to have the actual album art displayed. I play music through Spotify on my Android phone on Bluetooth, haven't tried aux yet. Is it possible to change this?

-

2. Also on my 2010 Highlander the startup was a little different, probably because it was key start instead of the push in my Camry. Basically it had two steps before the engine starting. Not good with cars so my terminology or what actually happens might not be accurate but, the first step would just turn on the audio system, the 2nd would turn on everything except the engine (displays, windows etc) and 3rd of course is start. I could go back and forth in the steps without jumping one.

On my Camry however, I only have two modes from what I've seen. I can press the start button without the break, and it'll turn on everything except the engine. And with break is everything on. Is it possible to turn off the engine while leaving audio system on? Or turn on just the audio system like in my Highlander? When I push to off, everything turns off.

None of its competition even offer rear passenger torso protection as an option, except for _some_ older Mercedes models, if you can consider Mercedes as a competitor to Toyota. These rear side torso airbags were implemented to compensate for poor chest/torso protection revealed in third-party testing--and not as an additional level of protection.

763,Toyota Corolla 1997,"Hey, so I bought a Toyota Corolla 1997, manual gear,  this summer, and it works fine, but now all of a sudden the car wont start. We tested the batteries and they work fine, so instead we tried to push start it. It then worked and the ignition worked aswell for a few days, but now its dead again. Tried to push start it again and now it works. Does anyone know what the problem might be? It would be nice to not only park downhill.

812,4Runner Dealer Installed Security Alarm,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm having an issue with my ‚Äò04 4Runner. I bought it secondhand a few years ago, but the dealer who sold it to that person installed a security system that includes a red button on the dash on the left side of the steering wheel. 

It keeps randomly going off and shuts down the car so it won‚Äôt start. I forget what the official name is for it, but recently it‚Äôs been happening every time the car is turned off. It won‚Äôt start unless I open the hood and jiggle the battery terminal connection, at which point the alarm starts going off. The car starts, but once it‚Äôs turned off again, we have the same issue. I‚Äôve heard you can get the system removed, but I wanted to see if anyone knew a fix for this.

816,"Test Drove 2018 RAV4, question for Toyota folks...","Hey everyone. I test drove a 2018 Toyota RAV4 LE AWD a few days ago, in the market for a replacement of my 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe. The car had 33 miles on the odometer, so it was fresh as it gets. 

As I was driving it, there was some sense of something wrong with the vehicle but I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. I think it is perhaps something instinctive, which is why I‚Äôm bothered but can‚Äôt really put a firm handle on why. It felt like the car was loose. Maybe missing bolts, but I know that‚Äôs impossible. It reminded me a lot of when I test drove a 2007 Toyota Avalon before I went with the Santa Fe. I was at the base of a mild hill, about to climb another one and I attempted a jackrabbit start in that Avalon. The car felt like it was an excited Cat, almost a butt-wiggle before the transmission and engine could figure out that I wanted to go. I returned that Avalon and never looked back, and here I sit looking at a RAV4 and there is something again. 

Now I have immense respect for Toyota, this is their bread and butter and CR heaps huge cred all over the RAV4, and I want to feel like everyone else does that the RAV4 is a stop-shopping-I‚Äôve-found-it car. 

Has anyone else had a feeling while driving the RAV4 that something just wasn‚Äôt sitting right with you? I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I should give the RAV4 another test drive or axe it off my list. I‚Äôm comparing it to the Mazda CX-5, Honda CR-V, and Nissan Rogue Sport.

865,Hybrid Car: Car Wash,"I had a quick question. What is the proper way to set up the Hybrid Rav 4 when it comes to going in a car wash?

1) With the brake pedal depressed and pressing the start button, the car goes into ready mode so the main hybrid battery is activated and being used. If the battery would get low, technically the engine would start to turn charge it. Now if I take the car in ready mode out of park and into neutral, I believe the engine won't ever turn on to charge the battery (not sure if that's true). The fear I have is running the car through a car wash in neutral and having the 12V battery or the Main Battery discharge as they aren't being charged by the engine at all.

OR

2) I think I can also press the start button twice on the car without depressing the brake pedal which will allow me to shift the car into neutral but it won't activate the high voltage main battery (only the 12V will be working). Is this the way I should do it?

I'm probably being stupid and over complicating this, but I wanted to check to be sure. Don't know the proper configuration to leave the car in neutral for an automated car wash so as not to run down the 12V or High Voltage battery. I'm sure I can turn off as many lights, AC blower, etc., as possible to reduce the power draw, but I still want to put it in the right state first.

929,Things to look out for (2003 Integra/RSX),"HI All,

After wrecking my GS I'm looking at jumping from the Toyota camp the Honda one and have got a few questions regarding the car i'm looking to inspect tomorrow. 



Typically, are there any 'unusual' issues i should look out for on the Integra? (2003 'Luxury' model). It also has a full service/repair history that i would like to flick through, i'd expect belts to be done by now as it has quite a few (170k kms) on it. I've been told that it's a pretty standard 4 banger and i'm pretty confident with identifying odd issues as they come, however i'd like to make sure there's no curve balls that'll wreck my time. 


The car is a bone stock manual. My biggest concern looking at pictures online is how suspiciously clean it is under the hood, and i'm a little worried that there might be some sort-of leak that the dealer is trying to cover up. 


Please let me know if this isn't the best sub to ask this on.

930,2005 Accord Purchase,"So I just bought a 2005 Accord 2.4L Coupe K24A4 with approximately 110k miles on it for very little money.  The previous owner gave me a bit of a rudimentary maintenance history which was basically just having the upper control arms replaced, coolant flushed and replaced at 75k, and regular oil changes.  It was mostly driven short trips throughout its life and garaged.   The only 'defect' (aside from tire rotations not being done regularly and the fronts being far more worn than the rears) is that the air bag light every 10-20 starts remains illuminated after startup.  I think re-seating the drivers seat harness fixes that problem.

So just putting together a list of things I should do to it to catch up on maintenance and modernize it:

* Spark Plug changes (ordered 4 Honda OEM NGK spark plugs)
* Drain and replace transmission fluid with ATF-DW1
* 9012 HIR headlight swap
* Cabin air filter (replace)
* Engine air filter (replace)
* Valve adjustment (ordered the tools)
* Upstream and downstream Oxygen sensors
* Alternator brushes
* Starter brushes / clean starter internals.
* Oil change (bought a case of Mobil-1 0W-20)
* Larger battery mod (going to get parts from junkyard!)

Anything else come to mind?  Ideally I'd like to do nothing to it for the next 100k miles other than a few oil changes -- if you had only a week with access to a garage and lift to get all that stuff done, are there other items you'd consider doing?   Is it worth pulling the caliper bolts and re-lubing them?  Any drains like the A/C that tend to plug up?

I know this is a long-shot, but I always liked having a real-time MPG (L/100km) reading and modded a 30-year-old car (with the old GM ALDL 110 baud system) to have that with some home-built electronics-- is there any easy way to do this on this car?

933,8th gen Accord oil snafu - worth a $1400 repair?,"Last year, I purchased a beautiful, fully trimmed '09 Accord EX-L, only to find out several months later that this generation of Accords had an issue in which a piston ring would leak oil irregularly in it, the chief symptom being fouled out plugs every  thousand miles or so. There was a repair period that conveniently ended a few months before my purchase. 

The issue itself has caused plug 3 to foul every 2-3 months, which I've been replacing - only the cost of one plug, after all. 
However, I don't know if this is affecting the rest of the engine at all. 
**Does anyone have experience with this issue on the Accord?**

I've been discussing it with Honda corporate for several months, and have reached an agreement that they'll cut the very sizable cost of repair down to 1400. 

Is this worth it? If the issue only ever means plug 3 fouls out and I replace it, I don't think the cost is worth it. However, if this repair saves me from more catastrophic failure down the line, I'd think it might be. 

Can anyone weigh in on the potential impacts of doing the care minimum of addressing this engine fault, rather than getting it fixed right now? I'd love to drive this car for the next decade.

I was wondering if a little bit of blowby is common or if I just messed up entirely. There are no fumes or smoke emitting and there is no oil on the air filter (2 things I was told to look for). Also everything on the wagon is as stock as it gets. Any help with easing my mind would be greatly appreciated lol.,1,7,scented-pinecones,1,1989 honda civic wagon blowby,hi today purchased 1989 civic wagon noticed little bit blowby coming oil cap wondering little bit blowby common messed entirely fumes smoke emitting oil air filter 2 things told look also everything wagon stock gets help easing mind would greatly appreciated lol,1989 honda civic wagon blowby ,1989 hond civ wagon blowby ,1989 honda civic wagon blowbi ,1989 honda civic wagon blowby ,1989 hond civ wagon blowby ,1989 honda civic wagon blowbi

957,Decision between high mileage Del Sol and Prelude SH,"Hey guys, I'm kicking the tires on two high-mileage cars, a 95 Del Sol and a 97 Prelude SH, but I need help deciding which is more worth the work of cleaning up and getting to my personal happy place.  Pretty much, I value a stock vehicle for the clean nature of it all, versus someone else's ""tasteful mods.""  Based on the details here, I think the Del Sol is the easy choice if I can haggle it down.  But I can't shake the thought of getting a Prelude SH.

1995 Del Sol:

* Asking $2800
* I think it was an Si but it has been engine and transmission swapped with a 2000 Civic Ex's D16.  Nearly identical engines, so shouldn't be super worried?  230,000 on the body, not sure about the new engine.
* Looks to be pretty stock besides some ugly wheels and ugly white/red custom leather seats.
* Paint looks good throughout, just a scratch in the back that I could care less about at the moment.  Interior looks good from what I can tell besides the nasty leather seats.

1997 Prelude SH:

* Asking $2600
* Attractive because it's hard to find these that haven't been modded to kingdom come or so nice they're Bring A Trailer worthy. Doesn't seem like the mods are too invasive?
* 190,000 miles on the original engine.
* Some dings and dents, paint fade on the hood.  Paint doesn't look too bad.
* Apparently a pit bull chewed up the driver's side door panel and seat.
* Seats are black leather
* Currently getting some exhaust work done? Any red flags here?
* Lowered
* Has headers
* Cold air intake
* Stage 2 clutch
* HID lights
* Stock otherwise is what I'm being told, including wheels.",2,14,fossilfarmer123,1,decision high mileage del sol prelude sh,hey guys kicking tires two high mileage cars 95 del sol 97 prelude sh need help deciding worth work cleaning getting personal happy place pretty much value stock vehicle clean nature versus someone else tasteful mods based details think del sol easy choice haggle shake thought getting prelude sh 1995 del sol asking 2800 think si engine transmission swapped 2000 civic ex d16 nearly identical engines super worried 230 000 body sure new engine looks pretty stock besides ugly wheels ugly white red custom leather seats paint looks good throughout scratch back could care less moment interior looks good tell besides nasty leather seats 1997 prelude sh asking 2600 attractive hard find modded kingdom come nice bring trailer worthy seem like mods invasive 190 000 miles original engine dings dents paint fade hood paint look bad apparently pit bull chewed driver side door panel seat seats black leather currently getting exhaust work done red flags lowered headers cold air intake stage 2 clutch hid lights stock otherwise told including wheels,decision high mileage del sol prelude sh ,decid high mil del sol prelud sh ,decis high mileag del sol prelud sh ,decision high mileage del sol prelude sh ,decid high mil del sol prelud sh ,decis high mileag del sol prelud sh

Do you think that my 2012 accord LX-P will last me 20 years/260k miles with the following maintenance schedule? I'm currently at 6.5 years @ 85k miles. I know Honda has Maintenance Minder but I feel like a lot of items are called to be serviced too soon. The following schedule seeks to get repairs at the appropriate time but to also save money:

**Every 6 months/6,000-7,500 miles:**

**Every 50,000 miles:**

Change Cabin Air Filter (DIY)

Change Engine Air Filter (DIY)

&amp;#x200B;

**Change Battery (when it gets close to dying)**

**Change brake pads (when they start to sqeal)**

&amp;#x200B;

**At 100,000 miles only:**

1031,Disconnect xm reception.,"I have a 2007 Accord that I bought used. With the regular non-navi headunit. The previous owners has an auxiliary cord connected to somewhere. In order to use it, you have to switch to XM. Guessing it's wired into the XM unit somehow, to carry the aux input over the XM radio. I did a similar thing on an old Camaro I had, but through the CD player. Needed a CD playing to work. It would just cancel out the music from the CD and transmit whatever you had plugged in instead.

In this case though it doesn't cancel out the XM so it still plays along with my phone. I have no XM subscription so it just keeps playing ads to get me to sign up.

Is there anyway to cut the reception to the XM unit so it doesn't play anything? But still technically goes into XM mode? Sort of a ""silent station"".

1032,RATS EATING WIRES - 2015 Honda Fit,"Hello r/Honda, I wanted to send this question out there in hopes that someone here has been dealing with a similar problem (wish we didn‚Äôt have to deal with this) and potentially has some advice.

Two times in 11 months, wires in my car have been, according to Honda, eaten by rodents. The first time this happened; all lights in and on my car wouldn‚Äôt work - ended up costing $700 to fix. Second time it happened this week; engine light came on and the car went into a ‚Äòlimp mode‚Äô - cost $1100 to fix this time, but during the fix I was informed it looks like the broken wires caused a short in the computer and was told the computer would most-likely need to be fixed as well at a cost well above $2000. 

Close to $4000 in repairs on a car that is still under warranty and only has 65,000km on it. Now if the computer does fail, should I get it fixed at Honda? The car is a least with about 16 months left on it.

How do you keep rats away? Should I be claiming these repairs under insurance? 

Any and all advice is appreciated.

Hi guys,

I'm thinking about buying the Honda Insight 2019 because I'm really blown away by the Fuel Economy and I really liked my test drive.

But the more I read the manuals and features the more confused I am. I have some questions and I'd be very grateful if someone could answer them for me

* I understand what the EV, Econ and Sport modes are for, but how do they work? Can I do that one pedal drive thing in EV mode that electric cars do? Can I select *no mode* if I don't want to have an aggressive throttle response, I'm not trying to go as far as I can nor am I trying to drive electric only and I'm just trying to drive regular balance?
* How do the paddle shifters work? Will the car slow down faster when I am not pressing the gas if the paddle shifter is at max regenerative braking? Can I not hit the brake at all when I use the paddle shifters (at the appropriate speed of course)?
* What's the button with the circle around the car for?
* Do any of you own it? Would you recommend it for someone who is buying their first *new* car ?
* Do any of you use Android Auto on it? I have the road sense of a dog, I can sometimes get lost in my own neighborhood and I want to have a bigger maps display with the comfort of Android, I don't really care about text messages or email or music or voice navigation. I just need big maps. Which is pretty much the only reason I am considering the EX trim over the LX one. Is Android Auto really worth the almost 2k price difference?

In other words, is there a part on this vehicle that is more difficult to replace than it should be?

1099,"New Car, Old Car","So the old car is a 96 Civic with 275k. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm driving down the highway when, suddenly, the engine sounds really rough. It sounded like I just lost the exhaust, but worse.  Pulled over and looked under the hood.  One of the spark plug wires was disconnected and melted at the connection end. The tip of the spark plug was hanging out of the engine and when i touched it , it fell back in to the engine.  I thought the plug was blown out of the engine and the car was shot.  There was a dent in the hood where the plug/wire hit. Towed it back to the house and went car shopping.

&amp;#x200B;

The new car is a 2018 Civic. I couldn't find a standard, but I love it nonetheless. Driving a new car feels great, especially the smooth drive and the lack of sensation that you may break down at any moment. This was my first new car purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

 But I still had the 96 Civic in the driveway. Friends told me I should have towed it to the dealership as a trade-in, but this didn't seen like a good negotiating tactic.  And I wasn't ready to give up yet. I drove this car across the county.  I bought it for $500 with 162,000 and put over 100k on it with minimal repairs.  I bought a new spark plug and used and old wire and it stared right up.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I think it's a good idea to drive the old car and keep the new one in the garage to use occasionally.  I commute 30 miles each way to work, so why not reduce the use on my new car?  Most of my friends and family think I'm crazy and should sell the old car and enjoy the new one.  When I drive the old one, I still get a feeling of less stress knowing I have a brand new car at home if something happens.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my questions are;  What do you think about keeping a 2nd car (insurance is $100 extra per year)?

1122,2017 Civic Si with Stage 4 clutch,"Hey guys, I just got a 2017 Civic Si from a dealer. I‚Äôm currently living in Hawaii, any every car with after market parts has to have Reconstruction (recon) paperwork and a tag on the vehicle. I noticed a recon tag and asked multiple times if there was any aftermarket parts in it or on it. They said no.

When I test drove the car the engine seemed like it was being bogged at 1.5k-2k rpms, and the clutch was engaging unexpectedly hard. My girlfriend‚Äôs STi engages in a similar way so I just chocked it up to being the way the car drives, as did my girlfriend (who is honestly MUCH more car savvy than I am).

While I was signing paperwork on the loan the salesman told my girlfriend (while I wasn‚Äôt present) that the car had a stage 4 clutch.

Now, why this car that has absolutely 0 aftermarket parts in it has a stage 4 clutch is absolutely so far beyond me. Maybe the previous owner wanted to supe it up into a track car but realized he couldn‚Äôt afford it?

I know I‚Äôm pretty much screwed on getting any sort of monetary compensation for that, because I signed multiple pieces of paper stating that I agreed to buy the car as is.

I‚Äôm just wanting to know if anyone who has more experience with higher stage clutches can tell me if it‚Äôs normal that my engine is getting uncontrollably bogged between 1k-2k rpms. Also if I let go of the clutch with more than an ass hair of pressure applied on the gas my tires will squeal and it‚Äôll launch forward and engage with some serious fucking force.

My logic here is that the engine is getting bogged at those rpms because my car has literally 1/2 the ft/lbs of torque that a stage 4 clutch should be handling. So the clutch is waiting for this torque that never comes and it bogs my engine. Is this correct?

Also while I‚Äôm here, what are the best ways to increase torque at lower rpms?

1247,Looking for advice on transmission for 98 Accord LX 2.3L,"So this car has 97k miles on her. Automatic. Slips a little bit when shifting gears. I checked the fluid and it was a tad low so I topped off then it stopped. Then started back up the next drive. Now it does it more often than not. Fluid level has remained the same since topping off. When I originally checked it, the fluid was slightly more brown than the original color that transmission fluid is.

1256,2018 Civic Type R buzzing noise from engine,"My family has been driving the type R for 5000 miles at this point, and for most of that time we‚Äôve been hearing a high pitched buzzing noise, almost like a cicada sound, from the engine bay. It seems to be tied to the throttle position. It can be heard in neutral while stopped, so it‚Äôs probably not transmission. Sometimes it‚Äôs not noticeable, but sometimes it‚Äôs a prominent noise that gets louder than the exhaust drone. It doesn‚Äôt seem related to the engine temperature either, as we‚Äôve heard it on long or short drives. We took it to one dealership, but they couldn‚Äôt recreate the noise. So far I‚Äôve pulled out the air filter to make sure nothing‚Äôs stuck in it, and I can confirm the engine hits peak power and 23psi of boost no problem. There haven‚Äôt been any codes, and we took it for an oil change and still hear the noise after that. Any ideas?

1302,Issue with 2nd Gen CRV Rear Door,"Hey All,

I recently acquired an frustrating problem with my 2006 Honda CRV. A few weeks ago I was moving apartments, and I put a large mattress in my CRV. At first, I couldn't quite close the back door on it, so I (stupidly) just pushed and pushed until I could close the door. The mattress was then pressing against the rear glass window for the few minutes of the ride.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was driving with the mattress, my dashboard light was telling me the backdoor was ajar. No problem - or so I thought. After I took out the mattress, my car has continued to say the rear door is open.  I can close the door, and lock it manually. I can do the same for the window, so I don't think it's an issue with the door not actually locking. I suspect I messed up some wiring or some sensor in the door, but I don't know enough to really be able to tell. 

&amp;#x200B;

This issue is not too serious, as the door still locks, but I had to shut off the trunk light (because it would always stay on) and I can't use my keyfob to lock the car (because technically a door is open!). Neither one of these is serious but both are annoying!

If any of yall have suggestions on what to do, please let me know!!

I have a 2014 Honda Accord EXL, and because I'm not happy with the factory stereo and want Carplay, I've decided to switch out the factory head unit for a Sony XAV AX200.

Does anyone here know if this is true? Because while I really want to change units and get Carplay, I'm not completely sure if I want to do it at the cost of FCW and Lanewatch. Also, as a bit of extra information, I do plan to buy whatever adapters are necessary to retain function of my factory ""iMid"" color screen.

1325,1G CRX swap options.,"I have a carb'd crx that is caged and prepped for champcar. I believe it's an 84 due to being carberated but could be wrong and that also may be irrelevant. I'm looking to find the path of least resistance to swapping the drivetrain to something more spirited. I was told the 1g integras was a direct swap..but later told no. This is for my Veterans outreach www.racingforheroes.org I have a lot of resources but trying to keep it budget friendly.
Realistic options:

1.  Buy 87 running refreshed integra b16a1, swap everything over.. will I need mounts or will everything swap? It's the same generation so I assume it's pretty straight forward.

2.  94/95 civic b16a8 it's running, more power, better aftermarket. I know I will need a ""hasport or similar"" mount kit.

I saw a 2015 Acura TLX V6 w/ 20k miles + Technology Package for a really good price. However, I was doing some research and saw that some problems reported with the car often revolve around the transmission and a vibration problem when driving on the highway. Does anybody have any experience or insight to these cars? I really like the look and the fact that it has a V6 compared to the new Honda's with the turbo engines since it looks like people are reporting oil dilution problems with those.

1388,"Added wrong fluid to CVT, NEED ADVICE","Service minder popped up in my 2014 Honda civic and called for a transmission fluid change at about 58k miles. I mistakenly bought Genuine Honda CVT fluid part number  08200-9006 and poured 4 quarts in my transmission after letting about 4 quarts of the old fluid drip out during the change. I now realize I needed to use the HCF2 fluid, and on the bottle of the CVT fluid I bought it said not to mix the two, so needless to say I'm a tad worried. I can have some bottles shipped to me of the right fluid by Monday.

Is this going to cause a substantial amount of damage to my CVT  from now until I begin to add the new fluid on Monday?

How many drain/fill sessions would you expect to do before all of the wrong fluid is phased out? and How many quarts of the correct fluid should I buy? And how long of a time should I space out the drain/fill sessions?

1425,18/19 Odyssey Reliability,"My wife had settled on the Odyssey in her minivan search.  She was looking 14-16 or so, but after test drives, it turns out they're too short for me if they have a sunroof.  The 18/19 is an inch taller, plus you can get the safety features you want on a trim package that doesn't have a sun roof.  So I fit.

But of course Consumer Reports went from ranking the Odyssey as the best minivan ever to ""not recommended"" based off of ""far below average"" reliability.  This is all survey data, and they don't seem to break it down between standard mechanical issues versus the infotainment system glitching.

Are there any serious reliability studies done on the 18/19 Odyssey  besides the CR survey?  I've seen one extended road test by a magazine that bought one and drove it 40k miles or so, but nothing besides that and random anecdotes.  I'm not super excited about a boring old Sienna, particularly since it's gotten an inch shorter in the same time frame, but neither do I want to drive some problem car.

1429,"Random misfires, now car won't start.","So I was driving my '07 Accord V6 manual to work this morning. Going from PA to NYC about 80 miles pretty much all empty freeway. Shortly after getting on the highway, the CEL starts blinking, and car runs kinda rough at low RPMs and has trouble accelerating. The day before I had about a quarter tank of 93 (which I usually run) and filled it to about 3/4 using 87 (never really run 87 but was kinda broke and being cheap). The tank was showing roughly half when this started. I was driving in early before any shops would open and I REALLY had to be at work that day so decided to just granny it to work and sort it out after. I suspected that the 87 may be too low octane and figured I would top it off with 93 after work and all should be ok. After work I was going to take it to an AdvanceAuto nearby to get the codes scanned and see what was up. But that particular one did not offer the service and was the only one nearby. I'm tight on cash so decided to skip the shop, top it off with 93 and see if it sorts itself out on the drive home. During the drive I noticed a distinct ticking/knocking sound coming from the engine. But after a while it went away and the blinking CEL light would occasionally just go to solid for a bit. Eventually the solid periods becoming more frequent but always eventually going back to flashing. Upon getting back home, I stopped at the local AutoZone and they gave me codes for misfire on cylinders 2, 3, and 5. Also a random misfire code. I figured since the situation seemed to be improving with the solid lights, perhaps the 93 was finally slowly getting into the engine.

Decided I would disconnect the battery to reset the ECU and maybe all would be well?
Well like an idiot I disconnected the positive terminal first, then negative. Keys were out of the ignition. After reconnecting the battery, positive first then negative, the car won't start at all. Dash turns on, all lights turn on, wipers work. Think I hear the fuel pump priming, but starter will not even try to crank. Turning key just dims all the lights and nothing from the starter.
I doubt the non-starting is related to the misfires. I stopped and started the car several times during the drive and it was fine. I probably messed something up when disconnecting the battery.
I was about to go to a shop when the car refused to start and ended up not making it before they all pretty much close. And ofcourse with my luck it's right before Thanksgiving so most won't be open until Monday.

Soooo.... any ideas I could try to sort this out? Really hoping I didn't fry the ECU. Fuel and temp gauge move into position when turning the power on, I assume they get their signal from the ECU? So if they work it's probably OK? Do different octanes actually mix in the tank or do they separate? Might explain why the misfiring started after the original 93 would have been used up if it was all at the bottom of the tank. And seems to possibly be getting better right about when all the 87 in the tank should be about finished up if it was separated at the bottom. Get paid tomorrow so if I find a shop open on Friday or Saturday I will get it to them and see what they say.

1447,2015 Honda Accord Type S Heating problem.,"Hello,

I am the proud owner of a 2015 Honda Accord Type S.
Its at 40765 km and i recently fired her up after work to drive home and i heard the engine stop normal but right after the normal starting sound there was a audible Thud sound from the dash board a little off center towards the passenger side.

Since then i have the feeling my heater is not working properly.

Ive already performed the Selftest with the Climate control unit by pressing the OFF Button and switching the heated rear window on and off 5 times to no avail, it did not show me a error code.

So i brought it to the local Honda Dealer and he cannot find any problem says that the data he can take are all stating there is no problem yet the heating problem remains, i have to literally put the heating setting to HI and after starting the car it takes up to 20 minutes for the inside to be hot. This is the second winter i have the vehicle and i cannot recollect that it took this long or that my hands would be cold while driving before.

Also the auto function for the heat direction that i usually just use never starts to blow hot air towards the cab or windshield anymore unless i manually select it to do so, as soon as i lower the temperature control to 21C it does suddenly cab as well as the usual Feet mode.

Any Help what could be the problem here? Ive had the cabin filter exchanged while it was in the shop and also no improvement to the situation.

TL;DR Car takes up to 20 minutes to build up tollerable heat (comfortable, its getting coler every day lowerst was -4) and only on HI setting anything else and I might as well turn it off.

It engages at the top of the pedal stroke now. It used to not fully engage till about half pedal or a bit more towards the floor. Think he smoked my clutch? If so how much for labor to get this replaced? I feel confident I could do it myself but I have very minimal time at the moment. Any good shops to take it too in MI?

I've owned my CD5 Accord for about a year now and it came with a f20b bottom end because I'm assuming it spun a bearing noting the car had 360k miles on it. Anyways it ran great and I put a new timing belt on it and fixed all of the leaks on the motor but as of late I've picked up very very quiet knock it sounds like. It's been around for about a week now and it hasn't gotten worse but it started out of no where so I'm at a dead end. This is my first Honda and I bought it to learn more about them and since then I've done numerous transmissions, engine rebuilds, swaps you name it on them but this puts me at a dead end, I don't want to have to pull the motor and tear it down to figure out my problem. I've done valve lash and they are almost completely silent. F series valves will never be perfectly silent.

1497,Dealing with little rattles and noises in the car(2018 Accord),"Hey all,

I posted a month back about my brand new 2018 Accord. Cars still outstanding, barring one or two little things. Those things are some rattles hiding out in the dash area/ front doors.

They appear when the car drives over semi broken concrete pavement or rough concrete pavement. 

Noise is intermittent and sounds like someone tapping on the car's plastic with a fingernail. Sounds likes it's coming from the steering column or somewhere in the driver's side footwell.

Note, I had my dealership fix two rattles, one on the rear speaker tray, and another on in the driver's side footwell. Both were resolved with some foam tape.

Any ideas on mitigation? I'd rather not tear the dash apart and cause more issues if I don't have to.

I don't mind removing the door panels at all, and I actually have some dynamt type sound insulation I can put in them.

The rest if the car is so quiet it makes these little issues really stand out üòÇ

1520,2018 Accord Questions,"Hey guys,   

Long story short, my beloved 2000 Civic EX was stolen and totaled a few weeks ago and I've been car shopping since then. I've got my eyes set on a 2018 Accord EX but I have a few questions. I would really, really appreciate any insight that you guys might be able to give!     

1) The first question is in regards to the color possibilities of the car's trim levels. After having decided on the EX trim level (since the EX has Android Auto/Apple Carplay), I was originally debating between Platinum White and Lunar Silver, and decided on Platinum White. ...But then I saw the Sport trim in the 'Still Night' Blue and was blown away at how nice of a color it is. My understanding is that this color is only available on the Sport trim. Is that correct?    

Here's a picture of the 'Still Night' Blue on a '18 Sport: [https://i.imgur.com/YiT9crh.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YiT9crh.jpg)  

2) My second round of questions revolve around the wheels. I'm interested in the look with the 19-inch Black Alloy wheels. I think this would look amazing with a Platinum White exterior and Black interior. I know that the stock EX comes with 17-inch regular alloy wheels. Does Honda have the Black Alloy wheels in 17-inches? Or would I have to use aftermarket wheels for that? Also, since changing the wheels costs around $2700 (wheels and changing tires) when you buy the car new from the Dealership, would it be a better idea to have this done at an independent shop? And would installing aftermarket wheels void any warranties?   

Here's a picture of the stock look: [https://3-photos7.motorcar.com/used-2018-honda-accord\_sedan-ex15tcvt-8519-16978635-4-1024.jpg](https://3-photos7.motorcar.com/used-2018-honda-accord_sedan-ex15tcvt-8519-16978635-4-1024.jpg)  

Here's a picture of what of the Black Alloy wheel look that I'd be interested in, but with 17-inch wheels:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Honda/comments/975uah/just\_picked\_up\_my\_first\_honda\_a\_couple\_days\_ago/#ampf=undefined](https://www.reddit.com/r/Honda/comments/975uah/just_picked_up_my_first_honda_a_couple_days_ago/#ampf=undefined)

3) My third concern is just the general look of the car. There are certain angles where the back half of the car just looks awkward to me. And then of course there are angles where the car looks AMAZING. Did anyone else have a hard time getting over this? For one thing, I absolutely love the interior of the car. And I like the exterior of other cars like the '18 Toyota Camry and the '18 Kia Optima, but not having Android Auto/Apple Carplay (Camry) and the interior of both not being as good as the Accord have made me favor the Accord overall. It's just that there's something wonky about the exterior shape of the Accord that has made me think hard about my decision.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also do you guys think the white Accord looks better with the stock wheels or with black wheels?

* Fluid drain and replace for all fluids, but no flush
* Spark plugs replaced
* Drive belt inspected and replaced if necessary
* Leave the water pump alone until it starts leaking

1570,"Help with misfire, 2008 accord coupe v6 manual","I have a 2008 accord coupe v6 manual, about 115k miles.

It has a sporadic misfire on cylinder 6, here is what ive tried so far

-new spark plugs on all 6 cylinders
-switched ignition coil 5 and 6, misfire remained on 6
-switched fuel injector 5 and 6, misfire remained on 6
-cleaned injectors 5 and 6
-ran a half tank of gas with seafoam through

the misfire persists, but is not always there. If i clear the codes, it will drive about 50 miles before the code comes back on. usually when the code comes back on i can actually feel the misfire too. (either a rough idle, or a loss of power). Otherwise it appears to run well.

about 30 miles right now since clearing the codes (when i replaced the battery terminal) and the CEL is not on still, but the other day while idling it felt and sounded weird, then the CEL flashed and went away. Pulled over and scanned the code, and it was a cylinder 6 misfire pending code, which shortly went away. its been another 25 miles since then with no CEL on.

What else could it be? my Dad suggested that it could be a crank position sensor, as he recently had to replace that on his jeep because it was causing misfire, but his symptoms were a bit different. his CEL would come on, and it would kill almost all power to the engine until he cleared the code.

Would it likey be the sensor here too? its the 6-6, so shouldnt be related to the cylinder shutoff eco mode issues (this engine does NOT have vcm)


edit 1: i have ordered a gauge to check compression, will update once i have done that

edit 2: car passed emissions testing yesterday with no issues or warnings, check engine light did still come on 10 miles later. so its not generally having issues combusting the fuel, but the issue does persist

Edit 3: I just checked the compression. 4=150psi 5=150psi 6=135psi (didn't test cylinders 1-3 because the gauge decided to give out)

1594,1997 Honda Accord: What to be aware of.,"Hello all, 

I'm in the market for a used car and have turned to Hondas. I've been looking for a few civics but they seem a bit overpriced in my area and for my budget. I'm not looking to spend anymore than $4,000 really, and I'm willing to haggle prices if need be. As such, I've found a manual 97 Honda Accord LX sedan with 93k miles that I'd like to take a look at tomorrow. My experience with driving a manual transmission is about 30 minutes, though I'd really like to learn. The description mentions that the car is ""in good condition inside and out"", the car is ""mechanically sound"", and has of course been, ""well maintained"". 

&amp;#x200B;

So, if all descriptors hold true, what components in particular should I look for in inspecting car?  Would you feel that this is a reasonable price given the condition and age of the vehicle, or does it solely depend on the inner parts of the car? Finally, is it even worth considering a car this age? I can't say I'm too mechanically savvy when it comes to cars, though I'd like to learn more with my own vehicle.

1614,'18 Accord and Honda Sensing,"So, driving home from work last night in the autumn rain, I had some Brake System warning indicators come up on my dash - Collision Mitigation Braking System, Adaptive Cruise Control Braking System, and Road Departure Mitigation Braking System.  When I got home, I checked the front of the car and found a dead leaf (foliage, not Nissan) partially obscuring the Honda Sense Radar transceiver in the grill.  I removed the leaf and tried starting my car again, but the warnings were still there.

This morning, about midway thru my commute to work, the warnings dropped and the system seemed to reset itself.  So, I'm assuming (I have a call into my dealership's service department for verification) that the obscured sensor was the cause.  Anyone else have this issue before?  If so, how long from the time you cleared the sensor until the warnings dropped?  Was it time or miles driven?

I bought a used car (honda accord) last week. After inspection, the mechanic said, it needs a new battery as it is low, I changed new battery today. Since then, whenever I try to start, I hear a weird metal noise (buzzing noise) when I try to crank the car. It sounds like the car is struggling to start. Did anyone ever have such issue in such a situation?

1652,Modding a 2002 Honda Accord EX V6 from auto to manual,"So I have a 6th Gen Accord with the amazing and reliable automatic transmission in it right now, it's currently my only car with over 200k on the clock and kind of works. However the transmission, like all 6th Gens, is showing signs of moodiness and will likely go out on me some day. It hasn't thrown any codes on me yet in my 8 months of ownership. I rather like it as a car, but not with the auto.

I'm interested in going with a manual swap, but a lot of the posts and information are years old and while it isn't out dated I've been having trouble sourcing a manual transmission or a donor car to begin with. Does anyone know how or where I could potentially source a transmission and the supporting parts for it? Is there a professional shop that I could go to for this? Or is this a lost cause and I should just sell/scrap the car and go find something newer? I'm willing to keep the car, I think it's worth putting some more money into at this juncture as I really do like the way the car drives and rides and I could put more work into it to make it even better.

I'm currently looking for a cheap runaround that I will only be using in the evening and weekends as I don't need to commute to work by car.

It's pretty cheap at ¬£895 and I reckon I can knock that down to near ¬£800. My only issue is with the mileage - 177,000. My understanding is that this engine uses a timing chain, and if properly looked after, this mileage shouldn't pose a problem, but obviously the last thing I want is to spend ¬£800 only to have the engine grenade after 3 months. It's had quite a bit of work done to it to pass its latest MOT - https://i.imgur.com/CN1P9Pe.png - and now only has a couple of advisories.

1710,Honda CRV excessive oil consumption - I am I screwed?,"In the past year I've noticed my Low Oil light come on twice in my CRV, once in Dec 2017, once in Jun 2018, which I found incredibly odd. Got the car in for an oil change both times and the problem went away. I should've noticed this an gotten on it immediately - my mistake.

After the Jun 2018 oil change I decided to monitor the oil consumption of my 2010 CRV an it's off the charts. Turns out there was an extended warranty for this issue - except now I'm 4 months outside of that window, which is beyond frustrating. Service rep at Honda said I'm SOL and any fixes would come out of my pocket - I've had a ton of issues with this car. My understanding is this would be multi-thousand $$$ fix.

Car only has ~80k miles on it.

I've narrowed it down to four options:

1. Get the issue fixed and drive the car for as many more years as possible.
2. Keep adding oil as needed between oil changes and drive the car for as many years as possible.
3. Trade the car in for another one.
4. Keep fighting Honda on this (not hopeful).

Am I totally screwed? Any suggestions?

I‚Äôm researching a good daily driver car with good gas mileage. I‚Äôm leaning towards the Accord right now. I‚Äôm in no rush getting one but plan on switching to a more casual daily driver by the end of next summer. In my area I have a Black Friday deal going on of a 2018 EX-L NAV AUTO 2.0T for $26,854 (MSRP $33,860) by a reputable Honda dealership. I guess I‚Äôm just wondering are offers like this common? It just seems like a too good of an offer to pass up right now, but I just wonder if this type of offer will pop up later in the spring when I am more certain of switching out for a new daily driver. Let me know y‚Äôalls thoughts. 

Edit: also I may be possible to stack the $500 recent college graduate discount since my son graduated recently. I assume I‚Äôll just have to buy the car underneath his name. If possible, this may become an impulse purchase really soon haha.

1721,My detailed 2018 accord EX-L 2.0T review,"I recently purchased a 2018 Accord EX-L 2.0T. I have ~ 1 month and ~2000 miles on it. I was upset at reviews online of cars in general, and I thought I would add some thoughtfulness to them. The biggest downside being as a non-journalist is I obviously don‚Äôt have any other cars for 1 month at my leisure. So this is my review of the accord as a standalone item, not how it stacks up to the competition:



1. Powertrain (2.0T) 

(a) Pro: 

i. It‚Äôs quick! I love the passing power and speed of the 2.0T, good performance for the $2000 you will be spending (if that is your preference). 

ii. Decent MPG (again, for the 2.0T) I average 38.5 MPG for long highways trips which is very respectable 

A. This is ‚Äúgauge‚Äù reading but I tested this and it is fairly accurate. 

B. This MPG, for the 2.0T, puts me about ~4mpg above the EPA estimated rating. I urge you to ‚Äúdo the math‚Äù if you are considering the hybrid version for MPG. You‚Äôd have to drive a lot to make up for the $1500 for the hybrid compared to the base.

iii. No snow driving yet, but haven‚Äôt had any traction issues / wheel spinning issues in the rain. 

iv. Because of the number of gears, the powertrain stays fairly quiet even at higher cruising speeds since the RPM will be less than 2000, even going 75. 

v. It takes regular gas. A lot of turbo cars require premium (or suggest you use premium for your top trim though all other models don‚Äôt require it, looking at you civic hatchback)

(b) Con:

i. The transmission has fumbled a few times on me at low speed (maybe 2 times).
	
2. Infotainment / Electronics

 (a) Pro
 
i. Very smooth! Definitely one of the better systems I have used/seen.
	
ii. Physical buttons. I personally could go either way since I usually use the steering wheel buttons but they are there.
	
iii. A ton of customization! 

A. You can independently adjust the point at which at your interior / exterior lights come on based on the light sensor. 
	
B. You can have the tachometer display if you are using additional information or not in its slot. (This is not by default, you have to enable the option)
	
C. A lot of miscellaneous options like having the car door unlock all doors or just that door via key less entry, enabling / disabling the driver seat sliding back on exit, turning speed sensing volume on/off, etc...
	
iv. You can do firmware/software updates yourself instead of taking it to a dealer. You connect the car to WIFI or use a USB stick, which is awesome. 
	
v. I‚Äôve used android auto and apple carplay and they both work well. 
	
(b) Con

 i. I have a Nexus 6P and an iphone X. Even the iphone X doesn‚Äôt fit very well in the area meant for phones in the front. 

 ii. Nitpicky, but I really like the turbo guage that comes when you use the ‚Äúsport‚Äù setting. Unfortunately, it will only activate with sport and I haven't found a way to enable it permanently. 

 iii. ‚ÄòOnly‚Äô a 720p display. This is more of a ‚Äúprinciple of the thing‚Äù argument since I haven‚Äôt noticed many negatives than a bit less screen real estate. But my phone has an OLED 2k display and it‚Äôs like 4 years old. They couldn‚Äôt spare a 1080p display for a $30k car? 

 iv. No AUX port. I actually didn‚Äôt notice this until I saw a Reddit comment about it since I always use BT, but something to be aware of.

(c) Thoughts

i. Overall a very good system, though I wish there was some more information density in the display as there is definitely room for it. Additionally the only ‚Äúcar‚Äô information the infotainment system can display is your trip distance / mpg. I wish there was an ‚Äòapp‚Äô to display some more performance info.

3. Honda Sense

 (a) Pro

 i. Adaptive cruise control (ACC) is awesome. I wouldn‚Äôt buy a car without it after using it for long trips. 

 ii. STOP/GO (low speed follow) cruise control is also awesome. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt get a car without it. That depends on your feelings towards traffic though (and if you need a manual transmission). It‚Äôs ACC for bumper to bumper situations. It works more efficiently than I expected, for the most part it keeps you going forward instead of starting / stopping constantly. When I got the car / was test driving I was worried it would accelerated to as close as it could to the car in front of you.

     A. Not all cars with Radar Cruise control / adaptive cruise control have low speed follow (or whatever you want to call it)! I actually found this out towards the end of my car buying journey. The Mazda6 doesn‚Äôt, despite the CX-5 having it. I know I said I wasn‚Äôt going to compare it to other cars, but I did so there. Make sure you look at exact specs if this is something important to you.
	
 iii. Blind spot monitoring is a nice feature, definitely something I would prioritize in a new car at this point.

 iv.  Auto high beams work better than I thought. The first time I used them I was very impressed, they turned the high beams on/off basically where I would.

 (b) Con

 i. Lane keep assist has a bit to go. It‚Äôs (maybe?) less fatiguing on long drives and a cool party trick. However, you can‚Äôt let it go on its on since it times-out on your input. Any advantage is has, has therefore been negated in my option. I wouldn‚Äôt prioritize a car with/without it. 

 ii. ACC ‚Äì I know I said I love this! I think it has some room for improvement. The car will somewhat aggressively try to keep you at the distance you set instead of the operating range that makes the most sense.

     A. For example I wish that setting it at range ‚Äú4‚Äù (the longest) would go between 1 and 4 depending on the situation for efficiency, at least in ECON mode.
	
 iii. ACC ‚Äì usability. Again, I know I love this! However, the button to change range is a single button with no delay. So if you are following at ‚Äú2‚Äù but want to go follow at range ‚Äú4‚Äù (the furthest range) you have to press from 2 to 1 then to your further range. While this would normally be fine, as soon as you hit the button your car will accelerate to achieve your closer range. Obvious some inefficiency there, I think there should either be a timeout or buttons to go up/down your follow range. It can be kind of frustrating. 


 (c) MISC

 i. ACC ‚Äì I‚Äôve tested a few times at night when you can see when ACC applies the brakes (through the brake lights). It applies the brakes more than I would, but it still is fairly impressive. For example if someone merged in front of me while using ACC I may let go of the gas but would not apply the brake, and get closer to the car but not put additonal wear on the brake pads. Using ACC it will apply the brakes early. As a positive example, someone merged in front of me going up a hill and they were fairly slow. The car slowed down, but never needed brakes as it was going up a hill and could slow down via gravity.

 ‚ó¶ Overall it‚Äôs an awesome feature! I wish there was a way to expand the operating range for your follow distance to ‚Äú2-4‚Äù instead of ‚Äú3‚Äù follow distance. I don‚Äôt mind rubber-banding in the operating range if it is more efficient rather than riding closer to the operating range as the car seems currently configured.
 
 ii. Cross ‚Äì traffic alert seems decent for reversing, though I have never used it / needed it triggered so can‚Äôt comment on functionality. 

 (d) Audio

i. Obviously the EX-L has the upgraded audio compared to lower trims, but I don‚Äôt have any complaints. It‚Äôs not going to blow you away but it is a solid enough system.

 (e) Climate control

 i. I find how they tuned the climate control fairly impressive just from a usability standpoint. The full auto mode not only adjusts for your temperature but has a few other tricks:

A. It adjusts the ‚Äúmode‚Äù (where the air is coming out) based on seemingly multiple temperature sensors

B. When you start the car it starts blowing air on the windshield to prevent fogging 

C. It will set itself to ‚Äúrecirculate‚Äù (seemingly) based on the outside temperature. 

D. According to the manual when you remote start the car it will look at the outdoor temperature and determine if the heated seats / window defrosters come on.

4. Exterior lights

(a) PRO

i. The low beam LED lights are awesome! Wide area of effect and bright where you want them to be 

ii. I don‚Äôt like the daytime running lights as much as older Accord models, but that is just personal preference

iii. The front turn signals are really nice looking. 
	
(b) CON

 i. With all models but the touring the high beams are not LED. I‚Äôm not sure how they compare on brightness, but you will notice that your high beams are yellow and your low beams are white. Doesn‚Äôt affect functionality though. 
	
5. Keyless entry

 (a) Automated locking: While the official documentation I have from Honda says this is a hybrid only feature, I was able to find it buried in the options of my car. It‚Äôs decent depending on where you usually store cargo. I typically store cargo in the passenger seat, and an unfortunate consequence of this is when I walk around the front of the vehicle I reach the distance to auto lock. This creates a lot of unnecessary beeps as you are trying to grab your cargo. If you walk around the back of the car you remain in distance so. As an example: 

i. You get out of the driver seat and shut the door, the car beeps to let you know it‚Äôs activated autolock. 

ii. You walk in front of the car, the car beeps as it has now locked the vehicle. 

iii. You get to the passenger door and then it has to unlock, so the car beeps again.

iv. You shut the passenger door, the car beeps as auto-lock has been re-activated 

v. The car finally lock itself, and lets out a reassuring beep. 

A. To fix this it would just need a few second timeout time when you leave range, hopefully they add it as a software fix or for future years. I actually turned this off since it was becoming a nuisance. 
	
(b) Overall the keyless entry system does work as you would expect it to. And there are some minor customization options.

Overall very nice car and am happy with my purchase, let me know if you have any questions!

1732,2003 Accord V6 dilemma,"Hey everyone,


I posted a couple months ago about my 2003 Accord V6 oil consumption issues. Changed the PCV valve, switched to higher viscosity, added STP oil treatment for valve seals, did it all. Still using about a quart/1,000 miles. Car currently sits at almost 140k miles. 


Did some more research and I‚Äôve determined I probably need new rings. Honda shop near me (Pittsburgh) quoted me for at least $2,500 pending any issues. I‚Äôm shopping around for a better option but don‚Äôt know what route to take. 


Now my question is do I pay to change the piston rings? Or does anyone have a reliable source for the J30A4 motor?

* I get a rattle (more like loud clinking) noise now that it's cold when I hit bumps in the road. It sounds like it's coming from the driver side up under the dash somewhere. I know others have experienced noises with the HUD display, that's not it. I did have the windshield replaced so wondering if it could also be that.
* My instrumental panel LCD acts really weird after I got the latest update (the recall about the rear camera software). For one, it no longer defaults to specific information when I start the car. The menu is just displayed and I have manually click fuel, navigation etc. Also, when I do start navigation with Android Auto. The turn by turn directions show up in the instrument panel but after a few minutes it reverts to the menu and I have manually select Navigation again.
* Finally, the key fob lock settings don't seem to work. I have it set to unlock all doors with one push of the fob, but it only ever unlocks the driver door and I have to click 'unlock' again to unlock the passenger doors.

So I have an odd question (or maybe just odd to me).  I asked the over at r/HondaElement &amp; they told me I should ask this question over here. I have an ‚Äò06 Element &amp; it‚Äôs making some odd sounds. It‚Äôs got about 160,000 or so miles on it (bought it brand new). It makes a ticking sound when I‚Äôm sitting at a light &amp; after I‚Äôve turned off the car when I get to where I‚Äôm going. 

And something that‚Äôs a bit more concerning for me at the moment is when I hit the gas the car stutters a bit &amp; then it makes almost a grinding noise. I take my car in for regular maintenance and change the oil like I‚Äôm supposed to. So I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on. At first it only seemed to happen when I had the A/C running, but now it‚Äôs happening all the time. I just started noticing it in the past month or so.

Also, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had the valves adjusted. I don‚Äôt remember that whenever I‚Äôve had stuff done. 

It also just started making a grinding type noise, not just when I hit the gas (which is what caught my attention before), but now it‚Äôs going on while I‚Äôm driving. This new problem has literally just started in the past 3hrs.  It‚Äôs really concerning me because of how far I have to drive to work &amp; back. And I don‚Äôt want to get stuck anywhere.

1779,"Paint defect on new '18 Accord door, easy fix?","Good evening all.  Just got a new 18 Accord Hybrid Touring last week and gave it a good wash today.  On the driver's side door, smack dab where I'll be looking every time I open the door, I found this:

https://imgur.com/a/65FjE5O

It looks to be a fleck of something that got mixed into the paint when it was sprayed and then clearcoated over.  It's smooth and you cannot feel it because it's under the clearcoat. In pictures it looks like it's standing out, but that's just because the pics are not picking up the clearcoat as well.  Oh, and ignore the streaks, that's just from a wet rag gently going over the area a few times.  

I'm taking it to the dealer tomorrow to be looked at, but has anyone had something like this fixed?  I'm really hoping it's not a 'respray the whole door' kind of situation....

Thanks!

UPDATE 1:  Ugh, they were able to feel it a bit at the dealer ship (and from one angle I can feel it now too) and think it's a chip, not something under the clearcoat. They asked that I take it to an autobody shop (which is only open until noon tomorrow...) and get an estimate, and then they'll submit to Honda to see if they'll cover a repair.

Man, this is not how I wanted the first 500miles on this car to go....
